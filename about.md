Hi there! I'm a maker/programmer guy who bought a 3D printer some time ago. I'm the author behind some [programming blogs](http://code.yuriy.tymch.uk), [hacking groups](https://pharoclub.github.io), and one hell of a [PhD thesis](http://yuriy.tymch.uk/papers/quality-aware-tooling.pdf), as well as some other open-source [projects](https://github.com/Uko).

This blog is here to share my joy of 3D printing. I love having a similar level of reproducibility, as I have in software development. Additionally, the real-world physical creations bring much more sentimental attachment as well as the limitations of the surrounding environment. All in all, this blog is not about me, it is about having things done and solving problems with 3D printing. Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@yuriy_tymchuk) to stay up to date with blog posts (and occasionally read rants about programming).
